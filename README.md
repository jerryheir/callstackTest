# Run the application 
## STEP 1: 
Please unbundle the git repo which should be named "Jeremiah-Nwaeze-callstack-task.bundle"

## STEP 2: 
In the root directory, use command ```yarn install```. You do not need to run any other command except step 3 because a postinstall script handles the rest.

## STEP 3: 
Run the project on a simulator using ```react-native run-ios```
